# Galloping horse animation

&nbsp;
## Important Note

  - All the assets were provided by the [OliveStudio](http://www.olivestudio.net/) company.

### How does the animation unfold?
 - It starts with a couple of disparate shapes and then these come together, forming the silhouette of a horse.
 - The horse then starts to lie on its front legs and starts to mimic a natural galloping movement sequence.

&nbsp;
#### What tools (libraries) were used to build it?

- [Greensock(GSAP)'s](https://greensock.com/) powerful animation library called TweenMax.js.
- [Bowser.js](https://github.com/lancedikson/bowser) - to accomodate all the possible browser particularity fallbacks.
- [Jquery](http://jquery.com/) - for DOM manipulation and easier element selection.


### Extra informative notes

- The animation is built to run smoothly on all the major browsers (including versions of IE below 11 ; officially tested on IE 10).
- All the sizes follow an "adaptive" design pattern, with the container resizing when the page is refreshed.
- The animation works on mobile (even on the smallest ones, down to 320px) devices and tablets alike.
